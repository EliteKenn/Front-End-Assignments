A Web application that replicates the Bronx Zoo's animal location webpage, https://bronxzoo.com/animals
which informs a visitor the location of a selected animal and it takes the user to the corresponding web page
after clicking on it. In the app, once the visitor selects an animal from the drop-down element then the location
is shown in the location field automatically and if the user clicks on it then opens the corresponding web page

The name of the animal, its location, and the corresponding webpage are found in the given csv file

Used jQuery to automatically populate the animal <select> elements
 
 
Used PHP as the server-side programming language to access the file in the database and retrieve the value of the
“location” and the corresponding website for the selected animal
