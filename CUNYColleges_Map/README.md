A Web application that allows for full-text search of CUNY colleges. You are given a csv file, cuny_addresses.csv, that contains all of the 25 CUNY colleges (seniors and community colleges).

The user can do a full-text search in any of the 9 fields of the file (id, college, address, city, state, zip, phone, url) except the app will display a geographical location for the selected college. 

Now the user will have the option to click on the college's website or the option to see where the college is located on a map.
